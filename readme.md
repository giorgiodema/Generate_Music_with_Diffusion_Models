# Generate Music With Diffusion Process
This project was done for the course "Generative Deep Learning 2021-2022" and it consists in the implementation of a Diffusion Probabilistic Model for raw audio music generation. The Jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb` is an interactive report of what was done. The notebook was tested locally, hence the compatibility with colab is not guaranteed. The file `requirements.txt` lists all the python packages used for the project. Another requirement is to have installed `ffmpeg` that is used to play audio in the notebook (I'm currently using version `4.2.7`). Some cells automatically play audio so please check that the volume is not too loud before launching the notebook :)
