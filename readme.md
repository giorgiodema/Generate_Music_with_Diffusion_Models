# Generate Music With Diffusion Process
This project was done for the course "Generative Deep Learning 2021-2022" and it consists in the implementation of a Diffusion Probabilistic Model for raw audio music generation. The Jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb` is a detailed interactive report of what was done. The file `requirements.txt` lists all the python packages used for the project. Another requirement is to have installed `ffmpeg` that is used to play audio in the notebook (I'm currently using version `4.2.7`).
To run the notebook the dataset folder must be downloaded and added to the working directory. The folder can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yJ2R71b5M-XAVpqlVi_zojubk0bVtrM6?usp=sharing)
